Run `Init` before use of this library

You just run TGET on a TOKEN *                    

There is no special TPUT function. You Put a token using âŽ•TPUT.

* Currently did not implement logic for MULTIPLE token gets in one request
  although it may not be complicated to implement.  
  
  
  
TGET
 - Create a new request object
 - The end of the function will WAIT (TGET) on a psuedo token
  - This token is UNIQUE and RELEASE of this is controlled by the Schedular
 - Before we WAIT, we want to Run a job
  - This job must wait for the ACTUAL TOKEN being requested first
  - as SOON as it can continue, we release the GUID of the EARLIEST thread
